# PhaserCHOP-TD-Summit-Talk
A typical definition of an easing function is a one-input function--usually continuous--which takes input between 0 and 1. When given 0, it returns 0; when given 1, it returns 1. This project's purpose is to explore how a function with these requirements can take an additional parameter called "Edge". When combined with phasing, the technique leads to interesting results!
